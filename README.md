## Data
Three-hour Kp values were pulled from GFZ Potsdam from Jan 1, 2009 - Jan 1, 2020. GFZ Potsdam is the offical source for Kp data.

## Analysis
The data indicate geomagnetic storms of G3 and greater are rare and G3 storms are infrequent -- just a handful in an 11 year period. There were no G5 events this SC. 

## Conclusions
SC25, the current solar cycle, is expected to peak early at the end of 2024. Max sunspot number (SSN), and indicator of activity, has already surpassed max sunspot number of SC24, the previous cycle. SSN for SC24 peaked at 146.1 in Feb 2014. So far the peak of SC25 was in Jun 2023 with a SSN of 163.4. At this time it is uncertain if the peak of SC25 has been reached even earlier than forecast. Typically a peak cannot be determined retrospectively until several years after the proposed max once activity begins to decline.
